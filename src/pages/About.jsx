      <p>
        Grammerhub is a meetup for new Devs pursuing their first Dev job, those leveling up their skills for mid-level
        positions, or just starting in programming looking for a career switch -
        <span>Although all are welcome to join the conversation!</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        Our goals for Grammerhub&#39;s weekly Monday coding nights*:
        <ul>
          <li>Support independent projects and collaboration</li>
          <li>Build a community and provide accountability</li>
          <li>Provide opportunities to grow professionally with technology</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Who We Are: A grassroots group of volunteers applying our skills in technology, design, research, and more to
        support those looking to reach the next level in their Dev careers.

        How it works:
        <ul>
          <li>6:30 pm EST: We open our general video conference call (Intros, Q&A, Show-and-Tell, etc.)</li>
